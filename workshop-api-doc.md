# How it all Works

Libraries are grouped by:

 - Touches the DOM
 - DOM-free JavaScript

 Next things are grouped by when they're needed:

 - Required from the HTML
  - Challenge Status
  - DOM event listeners
 - Required from other libraries
  - Touches the DOM
  - DOM-free JavaScript

## Challenge Status


## DOM Event Listeners

When the DOM finishes loading we need to start listening to these events:
 - Button clicks
  - Verify button
  - Directory button, if exists
  - Clear status button, if exists
 - Eternal Links
