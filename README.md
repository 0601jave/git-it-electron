# Git-it (For your Desktop)

Git-it is an app that teaches you Git and GitHub on the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).

Previously it ran _in_ terminal (the command line application) with a guide online but now the guide _is_ the app and it runs on your desktop on its own, thanks to [Electron.js](electron.atom.io).

## Hello, future Forkers, Branchers and Pull Requesters!

This application contains challenges for learning Git and GitHubâ€”by using _real_ Git and GitHub, not emulators. You'll be learning the awesome (and not so scary) command line and GitHub which means when you finish all of the challenges you'll have _real_ repositories on your GitHub account and green squares on your [contribution chart](https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions).

## What to Install

You'll just need Git (since that's what you're learning), a text editor and Git-it. The first two you'll continue to use once you're a Git/GitHub Pro. You'll create a GitHub account in the first challenge but if you already have one, you're already ahead!

**Git**

We recommend installing [GitHub Desktop](desktop.github.com) (free) because it installs Git in the most consistent way across operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux).

**Text Editor**

<!-- I'm quite partial (I'm on this team) but [Atom](atom.io) is a great text editor (also free) and it is built on [Electron.js](electron.atom.io) just like Git-it. Visit the website and download the version for your operating system. -->

**Git-it**

You can view the [releases](http://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron/releases) section of this repository to find the download for your operating system. Click to download your version and then place it where you keep your other applications.
